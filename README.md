# catgirls_anytime

A CLI app dedicated to downloading images of catgirls. What more do you need?

Based off the [nekos.moe](https://nekos.moe) [API](https://docs.nekos.moe).

## Roadmap

[x] opening images in user's default image viewer.

~~[ ] showing the images in the terminal, like the kitty terminal.~~

[ ] config files

[ ] make code readable by splitting them into functions

## Legal

I literally don't want to be associated with this shitshow (lmao). This is why I am licensing `catgirls_anytime` under the license whose name is literally "DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE".

This means you are allowed to do **ANYTHING** with this project, and you don't even need to give me attribution.
