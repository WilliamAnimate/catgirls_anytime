# catgirls_anytime

A CLI app dedicated to downloading images of catgirls. What more do you need?

Based off the [nekos.moe](https://nekos.moe) [API](https://docs.nekos.moe).

## Roadmap

[ ] opening images in user's default image viewer.
[ ] showing the images in the terminal, like the kitty terminal.
[ ] config files
[ ] make code readable by splitting them into functions
